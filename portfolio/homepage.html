    <p>Here I am, an old man,A dull head among windy spaces.Signs are taken for wonders. "We would see a sign":The word within a word, unable to speak a word,Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the yearCame Christ the tigerIn depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunkAmong whispers; by Mr. SilveroWith caressing hands, at LimogesWho walked all night in the warm rainNor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,Bitten by flies, fought.My house is a decayed house,And the jew squats on the windy straitsOf Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,And an old man in a dry season.Here I am, an old man,A dull head among windy spaces.Signs are taken for wonders. "We would see a sign":The word within a word, unable to speak a word,Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the yearCame Christ the tigerIn depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunkAmong whispers; by Mr. SilveroWith caressing hands, at LimogesWho walked all night in the warm rainNor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,Bitten by flies, fought.My house is a decayed house,And the jew squats on the windy straitsOf Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,And an old man in a dry season.Here I am, an old man,A dull head among windy spaces.Signs are taken for wonders.
